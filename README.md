General

You will need to enable editing and macros. Certain cells have conditional formats which black them out if you input a zero. This is to make the table easier to read. After you have read this text box and inputted the values above, click the "Make Tables" button. Note: Each time you click the "Make Tables" button, all tables and information in the other three sheets will be wiped and lost. Do not tamper with "Weights" sheet.

Input Sheet

The Module/Class with the most assignments, class tests and even attendance (if it carries weight) has the most preliminaries. e.g. if Module A has: 1 class test, 2 assignments, and attendance is accounted for, Module A has 4 preliminaries. If no other module has more preliminaries I would input 4 above.

Module Information Sheet

This is where you will input the following information about each module/class: The module/class name, credit value and the weights the preliminaries and exam caries for each module.
Please ensure total adds up to 100% as expected.
After, click the "Copy Module Name and Credit Value" Button.

Module Results Sheet

The Module Results Sheet is where you input your (achieved or predicted) results for all preliminaries and exams. 
The "Total" row shows the current mark achieved in the module of that column.
As you input results, you'll notice the "Need" row will return the marks required to achieve your Overall Average Target Percentage.
Below the table you will find your overall current average.
